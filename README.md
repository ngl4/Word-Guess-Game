Basic JavaScript Word-Guess-Game: Anime Hangman

This Hangman game allows user to guess the name of some popular Japanese Anime. User can press any alphabet letter key to guess the word. If the user correctly guess the word, the anime image will display and its music will play alongside with it. If the user uses up all the available guesses, a correct answer will be displayed with the anime image and its music.

### Reflection:
I have struggled a lot while working on this game's JavaScript logic. Especially when I know or i want to create a certain effect, I will get stuck and will try to find a way out by doing a lot of researches on stack overflow. For instance, instead of using `.push()` method to push the letter keys pressed to replace `_` dashes with specific guesses (in another word, letters), I use `replace()` method to replace dashes with specific letters. This works too, but it is more complicated and I even need to test out all the answers on stack overflow in order to find one that actually works with the `replace()` method. 

From this basic game project, I learn to slow myself down and rethink on my code more. Instead of doing a lot of researches on stack overflow, I will spend more time doing pseudo-code. There are many ways to code and there are always a better way to code or a way that you actually understand what you are coding. 

I struggle throughout the production process of this game, but I learn to write code from scratch and only do research for checking on my own code.
